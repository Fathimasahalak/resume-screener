Project Description
Resume Screener AI is a web-based application designed to simplify the hiring process by automatically analyzing resumes and job descriptions using AI. The user uploads a resume and a job description through the interface, and the system processes the documents via an AI workflow built using Relay, providing feedback or compatibility scoring between the candidate and the role.
The project also uses Cloudinary for storing uploaded files securely and Flask as the backend framework to handle routing, file uploads, and integration with AI APIs. The front-end is built using HTML/CSS, offering a clean and intuitive interface for users.

Solution
This project streamlines the initial screening process in recruitment by automatically analyzing and comparing resumes with job descriptions using AI. It helps recruiters save time and make objective decisions by providing instant compatibility insights through a simple web interface.
